# INTRODUCTION

Aviation Risks encompases any potential Hazards and uncertainities that could impact the safety , security and efficiency of the aircraft operations 

Some of the Key Risks include the following :

Operational Risks : Day to Day flight procedures such as ground handling and human performances

Technical Risks : Malfunctions , failures , aircraft systems and engine

Human Factors Risks : Errrors streaming from Human performances such as pilot errors , inadequate training and communication breakdowns

Environmental Risks : Are mostly the Adverse weather conditions such as hailstorms

Security Risks : Mostly threats from unlawful interference including terrorism and cyber-security breaches

## Data source and presentations

We used data from kaggle :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses

## Business Understanding

Aviation's core business relies on the safety of the passengers , crew and Assets

Aviation Accidents lead to catastrophic loss of life , severe financial impacts and irreversible reputational damage .

A company seeking to venture into aviation industry , speicificaly on purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial or private enterprise need to consider the following :

Which Aircraft Category is safer compared to others

What is the trend of aviation accidents with time

How does engine type affect fatalities and does number of engines affect

What phase of flight do most accidents occur

TE environmental risks / weather conditions

## OBJECTIVES

Data understanding

Exploratory Data Analysis

Data preparation And Data Cleaning

Data Visualizations

Business Recommendations

## DATA UNDERSTANDING

For the project Analysis , we sourced data from from kaggle : Aviation Risk Analysis , Insights from U.S accidents data up to 2022

Key columns include :

Event Date - The date when the accident occured

Location - the exact location of the accident

Injury Severity - How critical the injuries were

Aircraft Damage - The impact of the crash on the plane

Make - the make or aircraft type

Engine types in the planes

Number of the engines in the plane

Broad phase of flight - Stage of crash occurance

Weather conditions

Among others
